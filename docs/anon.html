    <h3>What is the difference between privacy and anonymity?</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img src="images/Image3.jpg" class="rounded" style="width: 100%">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>We are conflating the terms privacy and anonymity, which is wrong. While an encrypted message can protect
                your privacy because (hopefully) only you and your recipient can read it, encryption does not protect
                the metadata, and therefore your anonymity.</p>
            <p>Who you're talking to, when you're talking to them, how long
                you've been talking to them, how many messages you've sent, the size of attachments you've sent, and the
                type of correspondence you've sent are all unencrypted and readily discoverable by sophisticated hackers
                with a mass surveillance apparatus, which is most these days.</p>
            <p>Before we get into concrete technological resources, one last thought: the term "online" has lost its
                sense. Cyberspace has fused with meatspace. We used to "go online" and "live in the real world." </p>
            <p>Now that we live online, items like mobile phone geotracking, facial recognition in public physical
                spaces, and other technology mean that no amount of "online anonymity" can help you unless your physical
                self is
                also anonymous, which is virtually impossible these days.</p>

    <h3>Don't expect a VPN to keep you anonymous</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <img src="images/Image4.jpg" class="rounded" style="width: 100%">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>We'll debunk the notion instead, since everybody wants VPNs to be on a list of anonymity resources. A VPN
                simply transfers confidence from your ISP or, if you're traveling, your local coffeeshop, hotel, or
                airport WiFi network to a third-party server. There are a lot of good reasons to use a VPN, but
                anonymity isn't one of them. It doesn't matter. Even at the bottom, there isn't much.</p>
            <p>The VPN provider can see all your traffic. That means that an adversary that gains control of
                the VPN's servers, by hacking them or by serving the VPN provider with a court order, can also see all
                your traffic.</p>
            <p>VPNs are fantastic. Make use of them. The good ones are much more secure than your local coffee shop's
                dodgy WiFi network, but they have no privacy.</p>

    <h3>Be careful what you post online</h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-6">

        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>Privacy is all about choice, about being able to share what you want to share and keep secret what you
                want to keep private. If there's something going on in your life that you don't want the rest of the
                world to hear about, writing about it on social media, where everybody can see it may not be the best
                idea.</p>
            <p>On this topic, there is a significant generational divide. Older generations despise the concept of
                airing their dirty laundry in public, while the generation that grew up with a mobile phone glued to
                their palm considers excessive sharing to be natural. All has its own time and place. Sharing things you
                want the rest of the world to see obviously has meaning.</p>
            <p>Consider that although sharing a single personal information about your life does not seem to be
                sensitive on its own, when combined with many other shared personal details, it may create an image that
                you may be hesitant to share on the internet.</p>
